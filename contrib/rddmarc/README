These are little scripts to parse DMARC reports.

The first, rddmarc, is a perl script that take an incoming DMARC
summary report email, extracts and unpacks the ZIP file, parses the
XML, and puts the parts about received mail into a MySQL database.
The database is set up to handle reports about multiple domains from
multiple reporters. It's handling reports from Google, Yahoo, xs4all
and Netease.

It expects filenames on the command line, each of which contains a
mail message, but it'd easy enough to adjust it to read stdin or
anywhere else.

It works great on FreeBSD, can probably be made to work on linux with
modest effort, no clue about other systems.  It needs the
MIME::Parser, XML::Simple, and DBI perl modules and the freeware unzip
program to extract stuff from the ZIP file.

The second is a python script to parse failure reports.  It expects
file names on the command line, or if no arguments, it reads stdin. It
needs the usual MySQLdb module.  It handles reports from Netease,
which are currently the only ones I'm getting.
