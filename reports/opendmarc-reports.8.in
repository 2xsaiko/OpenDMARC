.SH NAME
.B opendmarc-reports
\- OpenDMARC aggregate report generation tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B opendmarc-reports
[options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B opendmarc-reports
pulls data from an OpenDMARC database and generates periodic aggregate
reports.  The database is populated by a running
.B opendmarc(8)
filter as messages arrive and are processed.  This includes the collection
of reporting URIs, which this script uses to make reports available to those
that request them.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I --dbhost=hostname
Specifies the hostname on which the SQL server is running.  Defaults to
the value of the environment variable OPENDMARC_DBHOST, or "localhost" if
the environment variable is not set.
.TP
.I --dbname=name
Specifies the SQL database name to be accessed.  Defaults to
the value of the environment variable OPENDMARC_DB, or "opendmarc" if
the environment variable is not set.
.TP
.I --dbpasswd=password
Specifies the password for the SQL database to be accessed.  Defaults to
the value of the environment variable OPENDMARC_PASSWORD, or "opendmarc" if
the environment variable is not set.
.TP
.I --dbport=port
Specifies the TCP port on which the SQL server is expected to be listening.
Defaults to the value of the environment variable OPENDMARC_PORT, or 3306
if the environment variable is not set.

.TP
.I --mailcmd=string
Sets
.I string
as the command to which generated email is piped.  The default is
"/usr/sbin/sendmail -t -odq" which learns recipients from the header fields
in the message.  This is useful when one wishes to force all reports to go
to a single address, e.g. "/usr/sbin/sendmail -odq test-reports@example.com"
will cause all reports to go to the email address shown regardless of what
addresses are in the message header.
