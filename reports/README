OPENDMARC REPORTS
=================

This directory contains tools necessary to generate DMARC reports at regular
intervals.  It includes the following:

	opendmarc-import	perl script to import opendmarc history files
				into the database; meant to be run from cron

	opendmarc-import.8	man page for the above

	opendmarc-reports	perl script to generate DMARC reports
				whenever it is run; meant to be run from cron

	opendmarc-reports.8	man page for the above

The adjacent "db" directory contains an SQL schema to be used with this
package.  The opendmarc filter populates the tables in that schema as messages
are received and DMARC policies evaluated.  The scripts in here use the
accumulated information to generate reports, and age out old data.
