This directory includes the text version of the DMARC specification most
recently released for public use by the DMARC.org organization.  The terms
under which it is released can be found in the LICENSE file in this directory.
Note that the terms found there apply only to the DMARC specification itself,
and not to the remainder of this package.

The LICENSE (called the Open Web Foundation Agreement v1.0, or OWFa 1.0)
was signed by all of the members of DMARC.org prior to the time the document
was made public.  To request copies of the signed versions of these
agreements, contact questions@dmarc.org.
