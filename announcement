Subject: OpenDMARC v1.2.0 released

The Trusted Domain Project is pleased to announce the availability of
OpenDMARC v1.2.0, now available for download from SourceForge.

This is both a new feature and bug fix release.  Most of the new features are
based on operatinal experience from the field after almost a year since our
previous release.  Upgrade is recommended.
