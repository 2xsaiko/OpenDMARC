The full RELEASE_NOTES for this version:

1.0.0		2012/07/??
	Initial release.

0.2.0		2012/08/24
	Feature request #15: If there's no SPF Authentication-Results field,
		look for a Received-SPF field to get SPF results.
	Feature request #16: Add "RecordAllMessages" setting to record all
		messages (the previous default).  The new default is to record
		only those messages whose From: domains had a published
		DMARC record.
	Feature request #19: Add "IgnoreMailFrom" setting, allowing mail from
		specific domains to be ignored.
	Feature request #20: Allow "AuthservID" to be a comma-separated list
		of authserv-ids to trust as local.  The first one is used
		in header field generation.  Suggested by Andreas Schulze.
	Fix bug #18: Pass the absence of a "rua" field in a DMARC record
		to the history file and into the "requests" table.
	Prevent crashes when parsing horribly malformed From: fields.
		Problem noted by Todd Lyons.
	Don't apply a default IgnoreHosts list in test mode.  Problem noted
		by Marcos Digirati.
	Don't expire request records for stuff that's never been generated
		yet.  Problem noted by Todd Lyons.
	Register the filter with SMFIF_ADDHDRS not SMFIF_CHGHDRS.  Problem
		noted by Todd Lyons.
	Fix bounds checking in dmarcf_dstring_printf().  Problem noted by
		Marcos Digirati.
	Arrays created in-place from strings don't need to have their elements
		freed.  Problem noted by Andreas Schulze.
	BUILD: Install non-user scripts under sbin instead of bin.  Problem
		noted by Andreas Schulze.
	CONTRIB: Add contrib/init/redhat and contents.  Provided by Todd Lyons.
	CONTRIB: Add contrib/spec and contents.  Provided by Todd Lyons.
	DB: Add some indexes to optimize operations.  Suggested by Todd Lyons.
	LIBOPENDMARC: Fix bug #22: Minimal solution to alignment checks when
		no public suffix list is provided.  Problem noted by
		Todd Lyons.
	REPORTING: Feature request #17: Add "opendmarc-params" tool, and
		tie it to opendmarc-import, so that administrators can force
		reports for specific domains to go to specific destinations
		regardless of DMARC record contents.
	REPORTING: Feature request #21: Add "--test" and "--keepfiles" options
		to opendmarc-reports.  Patch from Todd Lyons.
	REPORTING: Add opendmarc-importstats.
	REPORTING: Variable verbose levels in opendmarc-report.  Patch from
		Todd Lyons.
	TOOLS: Feature request #14: Add "openmarc-check" command line tool for
		translating DMARC records found in the DNS.
