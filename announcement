1.0.0		2012/10/25
	Rename "AlwaysDeliver" to "RejectFailures" and flip the logic.

		recipient to the message when DMARC failures occur.

	Feature request #30: Improve logging by indicating what the return
		path was when a parse failure occurred, and what the final
		DMARC result was.  Requested by Andreas Schulze.
	Evaluate based on the envelope sender reported by
		Authentication-Results and not on what was in the actual
		envelope.
	REPORTING: Feature request #27: Add "--nodomain" to opendmarc-reports
		to skip report generation for specific domains.
